# Overview

**ProtonControlAnimation** is an add-on designed for animating UI nodes "the Godot way":
Add animation nodes to your existing scenes, and it should just work<sup>TM</sup>.

No need for custom containers, shaders or special scripts. Drop the new nodes in your project and you're good to go.
