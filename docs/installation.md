# Installation

## From the asset library

*Might not be uploaded yet at the time I'm writing this guide* 

+ Open the Asset Library
+ Search for "ProtonControlAnimation"
+ Click on the result and press "Download" 
+ Install the add-on in its default location `res://addons/proton_control_animation`
 
## From source

+ Clone the [Github](https://github.com/HungryProton/proton_control_animation) (or download the archive)
+ Copy the `addons` folder into your Godot project.
  - **Only copy the addons folder**, not the entire Github project.
  - You should see the file `res://addons/proton_control_animation/plugin.cfg`, if the installation is correct.

## Enabling the add-on

+ Open the `Project Settings`
+ Go to the `Plugins` tab
+ Enable `ProtonControlAnimation`
